```bash
agent
```

#### Include multiple directories

```bash
agent --include-directories ../lib,../docs
```

#### Non-interactive mode for scripts

Get a simple text response:

```bash
agent -p "Explain the architecture of this codebase"
```

For more advanced scripting, including how to parse JSON and handle errors, use
the `--output-format json` flag to get structured output:
